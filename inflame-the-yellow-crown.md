# Inflame the Yellow Crown

## How To Use This
*Inflame the Yellow Crown* is a short dungeon-crawl through the hive of an ancient sorceress bee queen. You can:

* Drop it into a hexcrawl using the hex details in **Setup**
* Run as a one-shot using one of the **Hooks** in **Setup**
* Ignore the lore and steal any interesting items, spells, and creatures for your game
* Most importantly, have fun!

# Setup

*A long-sealed ancient **beehive** has been infiltrated by a group of bandits lead by a stoat named **Vash**. Clad in yellow and black, the so-called **Buzzkills** stole from locals and travellers alike.*

*But then the **Hive** went silent again.*

*Did the **Buzzkills** wander elsewhere to pilfer and plunder? Or have they awoken something dark within the **Hive**?*

## Hooks


1. Leader of a local settlement hires you to stop the **Buzzkills**. 
2. Locals speak of the great fortune the **Buzzkills** have stored in the **Hive**.
3. Curio collector will pay 1000p for a powerful bee artifact they believe resides in the **Hive** (The **Yellow Crown**)
4. **Whitacre Willow**, the archaeologist, wants to examine the inside of the **Hive** but needs protection; will pay 300p each.
5. An ethereal bee queen visits your dreams, promises great power to whoever dons the **Yellow Crown.**
6. **Buzzkills** stole a rare **Jade Vine** flower from the renowned mole alchemist **Bottul**. He will brew a **Glow Potion** as a reward for its safe return.


## Hex

To add this into an ongoing hexcrawl, place a hex with the following features:

* Field of flowers, the breeze constantly carries a faint hint of smoke.
* Imposing **Hive**, sealed as long as any nearby animal can remember.
* **Burnt Birch** - Birch tree that was burned down to just a stump some time ago. Now, a small hovel built into the remaining stump. Home of an elderly hedgehog named **Plum**.
    * Small and cramped, filled entirely with an eclectic set of knickknacks.
    * **Plum** wears tattered robes with once-regal flame symbols that have long since faded.
    * Aloof and irritable, has grown distant over years of travelers’ disinterest in his stories of “the sacred flame.”

# Background

## 30 Generations Ago

The bee queen **Melys** sought after a great, forbidden prize: eternal life. In single-minded devotion to her goal, her hive laid waste to the landscape. They  stripped flowers bare to procure the vast amounts of life-nectar required for her ascension.

Animals and insects alike banded together in a coalition to oppose **Melys** and her rampant destruction. A great war ensued, in which they discovered she had been successful in her pursuit: each time the **Yellow Crowned** queen fell, a new bee would take up the crown and wield her terrible power. As long as the crown survived, she was immortal.

At great cost of life, **Melys** and her brood were pushed back into her hive. Unable to destroy the crown, great wizards stoked an eternal flame within the hive whose smoke pacified the bees and drove their spirits away. The Keepers of the Flame was established to maintain the fire, so that **Melys** could not return to this world.

## 1 Week Ago

A roaming bandit group lead by a stoat named **Vash** made their way into the sealed Hive-tomb, making it their new base of operations. 

The lone remaining Keeper of the Flame, an elderly hedgehog named **Plum**, was no match for **Vash** and her crew. Imprisoned by the bandits, he was unable to fulfill his order’s cause. **Vash** extinguished the **Sacred Flame**, and donned the **Yellow Crown**, unknowingly setting **Melys'** resurrection in motion.

To signify their new home, the bandits donned yellow and black clothing, crafted cloaks from flower heads, and renamed themselves “the **Buzzkills**.” They began stealing from travelers and locals, amassing a small fortune in the **Hive**.

## 3 Days Ago

**Vash** has sealed herself in the **Throne Room** and, much to the relief of the local populace the flower clad bandits have been quiet. Unbeknownst to them, however, something more troubling has happened: the **Hive** has begun to buzz again.

## Now

**Vash** remains sealed in the **Throne Room**, midway through a transformation into the **Yellow Queen Melys**. The rest of the **Buzzkills** are entranced in her spell, instinctively reviving a new brood for their queen.


# The Hive

![Map of the Hive](images/hive-tomb-map.png "Map of the Hive")

* Inside the **Hive** the air is thick and sticky
* Smell of honey and pollen is pervasive throughout, an almost sickly sweet smell that overpowers a faint smell of smoke.
* A constant, low, directionless buzz fills the **Hive**.
* During the day, the heat trapping ability of the **Hive** keeps it quite warm. Dim light from the sun trickles through the porous amber resin and honeycomb exterior, casting everything in a dull orange light.
* At night, residual trapped heat from the day gives continued warmth, but it's too dark to see without a light source.


## 1. Entrance

---

_The Hive is a domed waxen structure coated by propolis (a smooth, thick, amber resin). A small hexagonal recess at ground level marks the singular entrance to the structure._



* Door is made from the same thick propolis as the structure
    * Inscribed on it is a circle of bees carrying flowers toward a central crown
        * Melted into the crown is the symbol of the Keepers of the Sacred Flame
* A hexagonal crucible is embedded in the ground, full of ash.
    * While a flower petal burns in the crucible, the door becomes like viscous, flowing golden honey, and can be traversed into **[2] Foyer**.
* Near the door are a few scattered flower petals.


## 2. Foyer

---

_Honeycomb walls full of crystallized honey. Hexagonal patterned propolis floor, scuffed from recent usage._



* Just inside the door is a wax sculpture of a crowned bee with amber eyes, an empty bowl in its hands.
    * Twisting the bee's proboscis secretes 3 drops of a viscous amber, fluid into the bowl – **Royal Nectar**.
* **Southeast:** Propolis door propped open.
    * Sounds of scraping can be heard from beyond.
* Beside the south eastern door, the honeycomb wall is abnormally shallow and free of honey.
    * One hexagonal honeycomb is marked, visible with ultraviolet vision.
    * Pressing it in opens a secret door into **[2A] Secret Room.**
* **West:** Closed propolis door. Leads to **[10] Guard Post.**
    * Periodic, weak incoherent shouts can be heard from beyond.


## 2A. Secret Room

---

_Musty room with smooth dark-orange propolis walls._



* **Amber Amulet** lies on a honeycomb shelf.
* Spell tablet on a wax plinth: **Hive Mind.**


## 3. Trapped Corridor

---

_Short honeycomb hallway, ends in a wooden door._


* **East:** Conspicuously wooden door at the far end with a metal latch leads to **[4] Bakery.**
    * Soft sounds of steps on honeycomb and wax scraping behind
* One honeycomb near the door is hollowed-out through to the next room
    * A crossbow, affixed with sticky resin, aims through this hole, its trigger rigged up to the metal latch by a taut wire (d10 damage if triggered).
    * Pushing the door open without use of the latch does not trigger the trap.
* **Northwest:** Propolis door leads to **[2] Foyer.**


## 4. Bakery

---

_Large open space, honeycombs line the walls and floors. A faintly sweet smell of yeast fills the air._



* d3+3 **Buzzkills** diligently make **bee bread:**
    * Mix honey, nectar, and pollen from **[7] Honey Storage** and **[9] Nectar Processing** in a wax bowl, store the mixture in honeycombs, and then cap off the comb with honey.
    * One bandit periodically extracts finished “loaves” and brings them to **[8] Nursery**.
    * **Bee bread** - as ration, cakey texture, tastes fruity and sweet.
* Six alcoves, each contains a trampled bedroll.
    * Searching through each yields a **Loot.**
    * Stashed in re-capped honeycomb: pouch with 200p. 2-in-6 chance this is "baked" into a **bee bread** loaf.
* **North:** Crossbow on a wax table aims through a hole in the wall into the corridor, taut wire connects it to the metal latch of a wooden door. Door leads to **[3] Trapped Corridor.**
* **West**: Opening in the wall leads to **[5] Scrying Chamber.**
* **South**: Sound of buzzing gets louder, leads to **[7] Honey Storage.**


## 5. Scrying Chamber

---

_Pale yellow beeswax walls carved with a hexagonal pattern. Tranquil and peaceful, external noises are subdued._



* Flat amber crystal shard, polished to a mirror shine. Blemished by spots of crystallized honey where liquid honey has been smeared and dried.
    * If honey is spread over the surface of the mirror, observers can see glimpses through the eyes of **bees** of the hive and **Buzzkills** (Reveal information about an unexplored room).
* **West:** Propolis door, flickering blue light can be seen through the seams. Leads to **[6] Antechamber**
* **East:** Busy movement, sounds of scraping wax, leads to **[4] Bakery.**


## 6. Antechamber

---

_Small cramped chamber with a regal door. Honey-colored beeswax walls have been carved with hexagons radiating outward from the door._



* **North:** Propolis door with ornate carvings of a regal bee wearing a crown surrounded by workers. The Keepers of the Flame’s symbol on the queen’s abdomen flickers in blue light as though burning
    * **Locked** -- if  the **Keeper’s Talisman** is brought here the light extinguishes and the door unlocks.
    * Leads to the **[12] Throne Room.**
* **East:** Propolis door to **[5] Scrying Chamber.**


## 7. Honey Storage

---


_Honeycomb walls ooze and drip honey onto the sticky floor. A droning buzz fills the air along with busy bees._



* Honey coats the floor -- STR Save to pull away quickly.
* 2 **Buzzkills** assist 4 **Bees** in honey production:
    * **Buzzkills** bring pollen from **[9] Nectar Processing.**
    * **Bees** process it and secrete honey into honeycombs.
* **West:** Amber propolis door leads to **[8] Nursery.** A steady buzz can be heard from within.
    * A **Buzzkill** from **[4] Bakery** occasionally passes through with **bee bread.**
* In the alcove to the right of this door, the honeycomb walls are filled with **wax scraps.**
    * On closer inspection, the scraps are wax bee sculptures, crafted into strange geometries.
    * Most are broken, but 2d6 are intact. Worthless to most, but 100p each to collectors.
* **East:** Sweet, yeasty scent. Leads to **[4] Bakery.**
* **Northwest:** Sweet, floral aroma, leads to **[9] Nectar Processing**


## 8. Nursery

---

_Honeycomb walls and floors, each cell occupied by a bee egg or larva. Buzzing fills the air as Nurse Bees tend to the young._



* 8 **Nurse Bees** tend to honeycombs full of bees in various stages of growth from eggs to pupae.
    * Interfering with the young in any way will draw the ire of the **Nurses.**
* At the far side of the room is a wax plinth, coated in crystallized honey.
    * Atop the plinth inside the cyrstallized honey is a spell tablet -- **Summon Bee.**
* At any time there are d6+2 usage dots of **bee bread** near the entrance.
    * **Nurse Bees** consume it between feedings, and it is occasionally replenished by a **Buzzkill** from **[4] Bakery.**


## 9. Nectar Processing

---


_Flowerheads line the floors, the ceiling, and tucked into honeycomb walls. Air is thick with powdery pollen and a sweet, flowery scent._



* Two **Buzzkills** crudely extract pollen and nectar from the flowers into wax containers, before tossing the desiccated heads in a pile.
    * A **Buzzkill** from **[4] Bakery** occasionally drops off empty containers, and takes full ones to **[4] Bakery** and **[7] Honey Storage**
* **Buzzkills** and **Bees** stop contentedly for a moment here as they pass through, indulging in the sweet scent.
    * Anyone walking through the pollen cloud gains the **Pollinated** Condition
* Searching through the various flowerheads yields a turquoise **Jade Vine Flowerhead.**
* **Northeast:** Vertical shaft with broken propolis stairs.
    * 12” up the shaft is the **[11]** **Upper Level.**
* **Southeast:** Lively buzzing and sticky floors lead to **[7] Honey Storage**
* **Northwest:** Muffled voice wearily shouting, leads to **[10] Guard Post.**


## 10. Guard Post

---

_Yellowed wax walls surround a make-shift propolis prison. The prisoner’s periodic, weak shouts are the only sounds here above the pervasive buzzing._



* Two **Buzzkill Drones**, eerily still, stand guard at a propolis slatted door.
    * An old hedgehog with sagging spines shouts from within _“Help! Let me out! The flame must be relit!”_
        * **Plum**, the deteriorating Keeper of the Flame.
        * With the flame extinguished, his body and mind are fading. Doesn’t remember what the **Sacred Flame** is for, or what his purpose is, just that it must be relit in **[12] Throne Room**.
        * Repeats the **Keeper’s** **Mantra** to himself in times of worry:  
	_This flame is my life  
	This smoke, our shield  
	I shall be its steward  
	My soul shall not yield_
    * The **Buzzkills** will see any attempt to free **Plum** as an act of aggression.
    * One guard carries the **Resin Rod**.
* **North:** Propolis door leads to **[2] Foyer**
* **South:** Sweet, floral aroma, leads to **[9] Nectar Processing**


## 11. Upper Level

---

_Ring of echoing honeycomb hallways around the upper level of the hive._



* Thick crystal honey windows line the center, **[12] Throne Room** is barely visible through the hazy amber.


### Northwest – Crystalline Prisoner


* Alcove transformed into a makeshift prison. Three **Bees** crawl over a prisoner, secreting sticky propolis liquid, slowly encasing the prisoner in resin. A single **Buzzkill** stands watch, an empty expression in their eyes.
    * Prisoner’s arms and legs are already secured to the walls and floors with hardened propolis.
* Prisoner is **Lark** the **Buzzkill**, strangely lucid unlike the others. Pleads with any passers by for help.
    * They wear the **Keeper’s Talisman.**
        * **Plum** recognizes this as a key to **[12] Throne Room**, but does not as his possession.
    * Willhelp the party if it means freeing the **Buzzkills**, but will turn on them if they try to kill **Vash**.
    * **Lark** will urge any saviors to not kill the guard.


### East – Spell Workshop



* Three alcoves are occupied by **Buzzkills** sitting on bedrolls, carving symbols into **Beeswax Spell Tablets.**
    * Searching through each alcove yields a **Loot.**
* The fourth contains a raised wax **Thaumatic Honey Basin**, full of a shimmering amber liquid.
    * Soaking in the liquid are d3 random **Beeswax Spell Tablets**. Each has d3 charges.
    * Liquid is **Thaumatic Honey**, which seeps into and charges the tablets; d3+3 uses still in the basin.
* **Aybizee**, a ghostly blue bee flits between the **Buzzkills**, instructing them on symbols to carve.
    * Beeswax tablets clack gently together as she flies.
    * Takes finished spell tablets from **Buzzkills** to the **Thaumatic Honey Basin.**
    * ◦	Bound to a beeswax **soul jar** carried by a **Buzzkill** bandit that follows her every movement.


## 12. Throne Room

---

_Grand queen's chamber, with hexagonal propolis pillars, honeycomb floors, and large ceilings. A hardened wax hexagonal cup-like queen's cell lies in the center._



* Within the cell lies **Vash**, partially consumed by the **Yellow Crown**. An incessant buzzing fills the chamber as **three Nurse Bees** feed her **Royal Jelly.**
    * Responses from **Vash** alternate between **Vash's** raspy, frightened voice, and **Melys'** deep, commanding one.
    * **Vash** and her **Nurse** attendants, will aggressively defend against any attempt to remove the **Yellow Crown** or relight the Sacred Flame.
    * If left for another day, **Vash** will fully become **Melys, the Yellow Queen.**
    * The cell is full of 6 usage dots worth of **Royal Jelly**.
* Behind the Queen’s cell is a large brazier, empty and blackened with years of burning.
    * The place of the **Sacred Flame**. **Plum** can relight it with **three Rounds** of concentration as he recites the **Keeper’s Mantra.**
    * If relit, smoke begins to fill the **Hive**, **Bees** return to slumber, including the Queen, releasing the **Buzzkills** from their trance.
